# 1. What
***W***{: style="font-size:26px; "}elcome to the **Docker Template Stack Components (DTS)!**<br>

> [Direct Link to the Available Stack Components](#2-the-available-stack-components)

Docker Template Stacks provide pre-configured containerized development environments for developers who want to leverage Docker for consistent, portable, and isolated development. Each Docker Template Stack is tailored for specific development scenarios and includes a complete development environment with all necessary tools, dependencies, and a working template project for specific programming languages and frameworks.

## 1.1 What's Included

Docker Template Stack components are containerized development environments that combine:

- **Pre-configured Docker containers** with specific programming language toolchains
- **Can be combined together to create a (network) Stack**
- **Complete development toolset** including compilers, package managers, and utilities
- **Ready-to-use template projects** demonstrating best practices and architecture
- **Integrated development environment** with VS Code and Dev Containers extension
- **GUI output, using WSLg or X11**  Containers can be configured to display graphical output on the host

---

## 1.2 Docker Container Types

We distinguish between two container **types** and one container **property** type:

**1. Type: GUI-Forwarding Containers üñ•Ô∏è**{: style="color:#5f7f90;font-size:13px; "} <br>
These containers forward their (GUI) output to the host using X11 forwarding. They are prefixed with:  ***`App-X11-Forward`***  or ***`X11-GUI`*** <sup>[1](#note-1)</sup> prefix and are marked with the above desktop icon in this document.

>  **Host requirement**{: style="color:#5491fa;font-size:13px; "}
>  </summary>
>  <small> These containers require the **XLaunch** program to be installed on your Windows host.  XLaunch uses the **X11 protocol** to forward the GUI to your host.  Instructions can be found in the **How-to** document of the relevant containers. </small>
></details>

**2. Type: Non-GUI Containers**{: style="color:#5f7f90;font-size:13px; "} <br>
These containers do **not** support GUI forwarding and do **not** use the special prefix.

## 1.3 Pluggable Container Architecture üß©

The **pluggable architecture** is a core DTS concept that enables multiple containers to work together as a unified system while remaining independently manageable.

**How it works:**

- Any container can be made pluggable by configuring its `docker-compose.yml` file with a **network section**
- Containers with the üß© icon come **pre-configured** with this setup
- Containers connect via a shared external Docker network
- Each container maintains its own configuration while communicating seamlessly

**Benefits:**

- **Modular deployment** - Start only the services you need
- **Independent updates** - Update containers without affecting others  
- **Service isolation** - Each container handles a specific responsibility
- **Scalable architecture** - Add new services easily

## 1.4 Quick Setup Process

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your system
2. **Download**: Obtain the appropriate template stack for your technology
3. **Execute**: Run the provided setup script to build and start your development container
4. **Develop**: Open the project in VS Code with Dev Containers and start coding

</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.2em;"> &#9654; Key benefits
  </summary>

- **Rapid Development Setup**
  - Execute a single setup script to build and configure your development container
  - Automatically provision the Docker container with all required tools and dependencies
  - Launch directly into VS Code with Dev Containers and start coding immediately
  - **Time to productivity: Minutes, not hours**

- **Completely Isolated Environment**
  - Each stack runs in its own Docker container with only relevant tools and dependencies
  - Eliminates version conflicts and dependency issues between different projects
  - Provides identical development environment across different operating systems
  - **Zero pollution of your host system**

- **Production-Ready Template Projects**
  - Start with a fully functional template application that demonstrates best practices
  - Includes proper project structure, configuration files, and Docker setup
  - Template can be immediately built, tested, and deployed using containers
  - **Skip the boilerplate and focus on your business logic**

- **True Cross-Platform Development**
  - Develop applications that run identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Test your applications in production-like containerized environments
  - Use the same development stack regardless of your host operating system
  - **One container, runs everywhere**
